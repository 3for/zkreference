The development of this community reference counts with the support of numerous individuals.


\textbf{Version 0.}
The ``proceedings'' of the 1st ZKProof workshop (Boston, May 2018) formed the initial basis for this document.

\textbf{Version 0.1.}
	Prior to the 2nd ZKProof workshop, the ZKProof organization team requested feedback from NIST about the developed documentation.
	The NIST PEC team (Luís Brandão, René Peralta, Angela Robinson) then elaborated the 
``NIST comments on the initial ZKProof documentation'' with 28 comments/suggestions 
for subsequent development of a ``Community Reference Document''.
	Luís Brandão ported to LaTeX the proceedings into a LaTeX version, along with inline comments, which became named as version 0.1.



\textbf{Version 0.2.}
	The contributions from version 0.1 to version 0.2 followed the editorial process discussed at the 2nd ZKProof Workshop (Berkeley, April 2019).
	The definition of proposed contributions was made possible by the collaboration of \emph{scribes}, \emph{moderators} and \emph{participants} at the several discussions.
	The contributors of content to the document include Yu Hang, Eduardo Morais, Justin Thaler, Ivan Visconti, 
besides the NIST PEC team (Luís Brandão, René Peralta, Angela Robinson) 
and the Editors team (Daniel Benarroch, Luís Brandão, Eran Tromer).
	The detailed description of the actual changes, proposed contributions and contributors appears in the ``diff'' version.



\textbf{Miscellaneous.}
	A general thank you note is due to all that have contributed to the ZProof Standardization effort.
	This includes the workshop speakers, participants, organizers and sponsors, 
as well as the steering committee and program committee members, and the participants in the ZKProof forum.
