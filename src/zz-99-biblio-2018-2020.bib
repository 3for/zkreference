abstract="There have been tremendous advances in reducing interaction, communication and verification time in zero-knowledge proofs but it remains an important challenge to make the prover efficient. We construct the first zero-knowledge proof of knowledge for the correct execution of a program on public and private inputs where the prover computation is nearly linear time. This saves a polylogarithmic factor in asymptotic performance compared to current state of the art proof systems.",

A {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}VDF{\}}{\$}{\$}VDFrequires a specified number of sequential steps to evaluate, yet produces a unique output that can be efficiently and publicly verified. {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}VDF{\}}{\$}{\$}VDFs have many applications in decentralized systems, including public randomness beacons, leader election in consensus protocols, and proofs of replication. We formalize the requirements for {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}VDF{\}}{\$}{\$}VDFs and present new candidate constructions that are the first to achieve an exponential gap between evaluation and verification time.",
