Preamble
\newcol 
\newcol \githubissue{16}, \ref{issue:intellectual-property}
\newcol \Chan\ Improve the placement and context of the ZKProof Charter within the document:
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Moved the original ``\hyperref[sec:prelim:charter]{ZKProof Charter}'' to before the \hyperref[prelim:contents]{Table of Contents}, and placed it within a framing box (\ref{rev:charter:box-the-original}).
				\item Corrected a typo: ``standardardization'' $\rightarrow$ ``standardization'' (\ref{rev:charter:typo:standardardization}).
				\item Added an editorial note explaining that the scope of the creative commons license is widened to incorporate the community reference (\ref{rev:charter:widen-scope-creative-commons}).
				\item Removed the ZKProof Code of Conducts (since it is tailored to events, rather than to documents), \todo{while still leaving a reference to it in the ``Editorial note'' section.}
				\end{itemize}
