  % Latest update of this file: 2019-07-26
  % This LaTeX project is open for collaboration under the ZKProof.org terms.
  % The main file for compilation is zkproof-community-reference.tex
  
  %%%%%%%%%%%%
  % SUMMARY:
  % The initial LaTeX version 0.1 (2019-04-01) was a porting to LaTeX of the
  % ZKProof docs downloaded in Mar-2019 from https://zkproof.org/documents.html
  % The porting included editorial adjustments for indexation, consistency, etc.
  % The underlying content was authored by the ZKProof team/collaborators.

  % - Load new packages by adding \usepackage{...} inside "zz-00-y01-pkgs.tex"
  % - New commands with global applicability: define inside zz-00-y02-cmds.tex
  % - New content in the preamble: create or fit into existing file "zz-00-z0<d>-....tex"
  % - New non-appendix chapter: create a file with name zz-0<d>-<word>.tex
  % - New section in non-appendix chapter: create a file with name zz-0<d>-z<ee>-<word>.tex
  % - New appendix chapter: create a file with name zz-0<L>-<tttt>.tex
  % - New section in appendix: create a file with name zz-0<L>-z<ee>-<word>.tex
  % - Files with externally-generated figures: upload inside the subfolder ./figs/
  % - New bibliographic reference: include a bibtex entry inside one of the .bib files
  
  %%%%%%%%%%%%
  % LOCAL COMPILATION:

  % - the bibliography is using biblatex and biber
  % - check that 'biber' is set as the processor working with biblatex
