# zkreference
The official repository hosting the ZKProof Community Reference document. We are currently accepting contributions to the document, see the bottom of this document for an up-to-date list of all suggested and submitted contributions.

## Current Call to Action

We now call on those who have volunteered to contribute, to: 
  
1. confirm their intended contributions by June 22nd; and
2. submit their contributions by August 10th.

The submission can be done through the zkreference GitHub repository (start a Pull Request or open an Issue) or through email, by replying to editors@zkproof.org and contributors@zkproof.org; see below for further details.

## Description

There is an ongoing process to improve the ZKProof Community Reference (formerly the ZKProof Proceedings from the 1st workshop). We have now collected from the community forum the notes from the discussions that took place in the “breakout” and “proposal” sessions at the 2nd ZKProof Workshop.

Attached is the initial list of suggested contributions, including the names of the volunteers to create such a contribution. Contributions may be of several types, such as: writing a new section or paragraph; creating or editing a table; upgrading the bibliography; editing typos, etc. 

Below  the call to action with a more detailed description of the process, which lets contributors pick their submission medium of choice (email or GitHub), and allows the community to track the proposal of contributions.


## How to Contribute
IMPORTANT: each item of contribution should be accompanied by an explanation, which the editors will later use in a "diff" file that will cross reference all changes with the corresponding explanations. The explanation should include all of the following, in order (see the [existing issues](https://github.com/zkpstandard/zkreference/issues) :

- Issue title: <a title for the contribution>
- Proposed contribution: <a short description & motivation about the change>
- Related locations: <location in the document where the contribution should be added>
- Proposed contributors: <who is proposing to do something>
- Contribution context: <e.g., which session in the ZKProof workshop motivated this>

 We are asking an initial explanation (by June 22nd) before the actual contribution (by August 10th). The explanation can later be edited at the time of submitting the contribution.
