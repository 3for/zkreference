# zkreference
The official repository hosting the ZKProof Community Reference document and the submitted Community Proposals. We are [currently accepting contributions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QSSrz9IgcTDtzvwuufLuz19hE0y1FWwtrzNPZ9jVDU0/edit#gid=1588990810) to the documents, see below for specific instructions on how to contribute.

## Current Call to Action 
  
  1. __Confirm (or suggest) the intended contributions by June 22nd; and__
  2. __Submit the contributions by August 10th__

The submission can be done through __this__ zkreference GitHub repository (start a Pull Request or open an Issue) or through email, by emailing contributors@zkproof.org; see below for further details.

## Description

There is an ongoing process to improve the [ZKProof Community Reference](https://zkproof.org/ZKProofCommunityReference.pdf) (based on the [ZKProof Proceedings](https://zkproof.org/documents.html) from the 1st workshop) and the [ZKProof Community Proposals](https://github.com/zkpstandard/zkreference). We have now collected from the community forum the notes from the discussions that took place in the “breakout” and “proposal” sessions at the [2nd ZKProof Workshop](https://zkproof.org/workshop2/main.html).

The complete and up-to-date list of contributions can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QSSrz9IgcTDtzvwuufLuz19hE0y1FWwtrzNPZ9jVDU0/edit?usp=sharing). Each contribution is tagged as _suggested_, _confirmed_, _submitted_ and _integrated_ as per its current status, which allows the community to track the state of the contributions. Contributions may be of several types, such as: writing a new section or paragraph; creating or editing a table; upgrading the bibliography; editing typos, etc.


## Submission Process

__Step 1 (by June 22nd ): Confirm intent to contribute and identify items of contribution__

If your name appears in the list of contributors or you want to volunteer with a new suggestion, then, by June 22nd, please do:

1. Send an email to contributors@zkproof.org confirming (or refuting) your contribution, including the details listed below; or
2. Submit the initial explanation as a GitHub issue in the zkreference repository (see the existing issues as examples).

If you confirmed your proposed contribution through email, or by default if you’ve volunteered earlier but do not confirm, the editors will create the GitHub Issue for the identified contribution (see the [existing issues](https://github.com/zkpstandard/zkreference/issues)).

Each contribution should be accompanied by an explanation, which the editors will later use in a “diff” file (that will cross reference all changes with their explanations). The explanation should include:

- __Issue title:__ _<a title for the contribution; 3-10 words>_
- __Proposed contribution:__ _<brief description and motivation about the change; 20-50 words>_
- __Related locations:__ _<location in the (Reference or Proposal) document where the contribution should be added>_
- __Proposed contributors:__ _<who is proposing to do something>_
- __Contribution context:__ _<e.g., which session in the ZKProof workshop motivated this>_

__Step 2 (by July 30th): Submit the contributions__

Choose any of these three official methods to submit your contribution:

- __Email to contributors:__ send an email with your contribution and the (possibly revised) explanation to contributors@zkproof.org
- __GitHub issues:__ submit the contribution to the GitHub issue previously created about the intended contribution.
- __GitHub pull requests:__ you can also submit a GitHub pull request to the master branch of the zkreference repository with the contribution integrated into the LaTeX document.
