			Initial version. 
			Summarizes the deliberations at 1st ZKProof Standards Workshop, and subsequent major contributions.

\item \textbf{Specific to implementations track:}\luiscom{Consider revising to simplify, and to uniformize the format across all tracks.}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Also summarizes the deliberations at the ZKProof breakout session at Zcon0 
				(see \href{https://zkproof.org/zcon0_notes.pdf}{notes from Zcon0}), 
				and subsequent major contributions by 
				Benedikt Bünz, Daira Hopwood, Jack Grigg and the track chairs Sean Bowe, Kobi Gurkan, and Eran Tromer.

				\item \textbf{Ongoing.}
				Added reference to Daira Hopwood’s \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aZ1GUAJOBFuqD4GOo9HqAH8w4xJo7HM4Bjte5-wkdnU/edit?usp=sharing}{Zcon0 Circuit Optimisation handout}. 
				Miscellaneous local additions and clarifications. 
				Added brief discussion of recursive composition interoperability.
			\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{2019-April-01 (and ongoing):} 
	merged the six original documents into a single one, upon porting code to LaTeX;
numerous editorial adjustments for easier indexation of content and consistent style.%
