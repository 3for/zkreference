We define an interactive oracle proof (IOP) to be an interactive proof in which the verifier is not required to read the prover's messages in their entirety; rather, the verifier has oracle access to the prover's messages, and may probabilistically query them. IOPs retain the expressiveness of PCPs, capturing NEXP rather than only PSPACE, and also the flexibility of IPs, allowing multiple rounds of communication with the prover. IOPs have already found several applications, including unconditional zero knowledge [BCGV16], constant-rate constant-query probabilistic checking [BCG+16], and doubly-efficient constant-round IPs for polynomial-time bounded-space computations [RRR16].",

In this work, we give the first lattice-based SNARG candidate with quasi-optimal succinctness (where the argument size is quasilinear in the security parameter). Further extension of our methods yields the first SNARG (from any assumption) that is quasi-optimal in terms of both prover overhead (polylogarithmic in the security parameter) as well as succinctness. Moreover, because our constructions are lattice-based, they plausibly resist quantum attacks. Central to our construction is a new notion of linear-only vector encryption which is a generalization of the notion of linear-only encryption introduced by Bitansky et al. (TCC 2013). We conjecture that variants of Regev encryption satisfy our new linear-only definition. Then, together with new information-theoretic approaches for building statistically-sound linear PCPs over small finite fields, we obtain the first quasi-optimal SNARGs.",

The zero-knowledge property relies on the existence of trapdoor permutations, or it can be based on a specific number theoretic assumption related to factoring to get better efficiency. As an example of the latter, we suggest a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof for circuit satisfiability based on the Naccache-Stern cryptosystem consisting of a quasi-linear number of bits.

abstract="We revisit the question of Zero-Knowledge PCPs, studied by Kilian, Petrank, and Tardos (STOC '97). A ZK-PCP is defined similarly to a standard PCP, except that the view of any (possibly malicious) verifier can be efficiently simulated up to a small statistical distance. Kilian et al.obtained a ZK-PCP for NEXP in which the proof oracle is in EXPNP. They also obtained a ZK-PCP for NP in which the proof oracle is computable in polynomial-time, but this ZK-PCP is only zero-knowledge against bounded-query verifiers who make at most an a priori fixed polynomial number of queries. The existence of ZK-PCPs for NP with efficient oracles and arbitrary polynomial-time malicious verifiers was left open. This question is motivated by the recent line of work on cryptography using tamper-proof hardware tokens: an efficient ZK-PCP (for any language) is equivalent to a statistical zero-knowledge proof using only a single stateless token sent to the verifier.",
