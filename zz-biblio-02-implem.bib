A {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}VDF{\}}{\$}{\$}VDFrequires a specified number of sequential steps to evaluate, yet produces a unique output that can be efficiently and publicly verified. {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}VDF{\}}{\$}{\$}VDFs have many applications in decentralized systems, including public randomness beacons, leader election in consensus protocols, and proofs of replication. We formalize the requirements for {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}VDF{\}}{\$}{\$}VDFs and present new candidate constructions that are the first to achieve an exponential gap between evaluation and verification time.",

Such a system is non-interactive and publicly-verifiable if, after a trusted party publishes a proving key and a verification key, anyone can use the proving key to generate non-interactive proofs for adaptively-chosen NP statements, and proofs can be verified by anyone by using the verification key.",

abstract="Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge for general NP statements are a powerful cryptographic primitive, both in theory and in practical applications. Recently, much research has focused on achieving an additional property, succinctness, requiring the proof to be very short and easy to verify. Such proof systems are known as zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), and are desired when communication is expensive, or the verifier is computationally weak.",
